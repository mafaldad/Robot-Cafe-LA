#Project Title: Market Study for a Robot Café in Los Angeles

**Overview:** This project focuses on a market analysis to assess the viability of opening a robot-run café in Los Angeles. The goal is to understand the current market conditions, analyze restaurant types, seating capacities, and street popularity to determine the best strategies for attracting investors. Using open-source data on LA restaurants, the project explores whether the café can maintain success after the novelty of robot waiters fades.

**Key Skills & Concepts:**

*Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed data from a dataset of LA restaurants, ensuring correct data types, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicates.
*Market Segmentation: Analyzed proportions of different restaurant types (chains vs. non-chains) and seating capacities.
*Seating Analysis: Investigated the average number of seats for each restaurant type and identified trends across popular streets.
*Street-Level Analysis: Conducted a spatial analysis of restaurants on the most popular streets in LA, determining the distribution of seats and identifying competition hotspots.
*Data Visualization: Used visual tools such as bar graphs and histograms to display market conditions, restaurant types, seating trends, and street popularity.

**Key Insights:**

*Restaurant Dominance: Over 75% of establishments in LA are restaurants, while cafes account for only 4.5% of the market.
*Chain vs. Non-Chain: Non-chain restaurants make up 61.9% of the market, indicating that standalone dining experiences are more common than chain establishments.
*Seating Capacity: Chain restaurants tend to have fewer seats per location, likely as a cost-efficiency measure. Non-chains typically have between 40-50 seats.
*Street-Level Competition: Popular streets such as Sunset Blvd. and Santa Monica Blvd. are prime locations for restaurants due to high traffic but also face significant competition.
*Location Recommendations: For a robot-run café, Sunset Blvd. with 14-29 seats or Santa Monica Blvd. with 2-3 seats are ideal choices based on the seating capacity and market trends.

**Tools Used:**

* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): For data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
